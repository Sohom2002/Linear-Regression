# Linear-Regression
ML model using LinearRegression for prediction
The CSV is included with the code.

We need to predict the price of the house in USA based on the given Parameters.
Detailed steps are shown in the Code

After using Linear Regression Model, We find the R^2 Value to be 0.917
Thus we can say that the efficiency of the model if 91.7%

There are still scopes to improve this model, but the basic solution is efficient enough.
