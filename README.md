# Linear-Regression
ML model using LinearRegression for prediction
The CSV is included with the code.

We need to predict the price of the house in USA based on the given Parameters.
Detailed steps are shown in the Code

Here the Target Column is "Price".
Influencing Column Attributes are "Avg. Area Income", "Avg. Area House Age", "Avg. Area Number of Rooms", "Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms" and "Area Population".

Let,
y = Price
x1 = Avg. Area Income
x2 = Avg. Area House Age
x3 = Avg. Area Number of Rooms
x4 = Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms
x5 = Area Population

So the Multiple Linear Regression Equation is
y = b0 + b1.x1 + b2.x2 + b3.x3 + b4.x4 + b5.x5, where b0 = constant

After using Linear Regression Model, We find the R^2 Value to be 0.917
Thus we can say that the efficiency of the model if 91.7%

There are still scopes to improve this model, but the basic solution is efficient enough.
